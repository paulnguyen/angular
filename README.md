### Getting Started

#### Install the Angular CLI

You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```      
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

#### Create a workspace and initial application

You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace.

To create a new workspace and initial starter app:

* Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:

  ```
  ng new my-app
  ```
  ![ng-new-my-app](images/ng-new-my-app.png)
 
        
* The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.

The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run.


#### Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

* Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.
* Run the following command:

```    
cd my-app
ng serve --open
```

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.

If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a page similar to the following.

1. For a more thorough introduction to the fundamental concepts and terminology of Angular single-page app architecture and design principles, read the Angular Concepts section.

2. Work through the Tour of Heroes Tutorial, a complete hands-on exercise that introduces you to the app development process using the Angular CLI and walks through important subsystems.

3. To learn more about using the Angular CLI, see the CLI Overview. In addition to creating the initial workspace and app scaffolding, you can use the CLI to generate Angular code such as components and services. The CLI supports the full development cycle, including building, testing, bundling, and deployment.
